</p><p id="title"><b>Aunt T.T. the Boss!</b></p>
<p class="notice" style="float:right;margin-top:-100px;margin-right:100px;">© June 1, 2020</p>
<br><br>

<p>This is a story about a pimp's last streetwalker (AKA bottom bitch) who becomes his lifemate and after years of being out of the game, he was set up and murdered... Now, T.T. has to survive on her own and somehow becomes an underground boss of a major operation run by now-grown children, orphaned by serial killers. This story shows the lives of the unwanted and forgotten children of murdered hookers and one woman's love to care and provide for and understand and track which ones can be functional in society and which of these children could be damaged beyond repair. In this story, there would be elements of organized crime, gunplay, some laughs, street justice, and serial predators because hookers are easy prey. This story deals with the survival skills of a brilliant, caring woman who is forced to be responsible and who feels tremendous pressure to keep people close to her safe, and also deals with the psyche of traumatized children, T.T. (AKA Aunt T.T. the Boss, or Lord Mother), who at the beginning is just known as a mild-mannered babysitter on the block, but in reality, is an incognito boss, runs a well-oiled machine who also has many street enforcers to handle all the bad mobsters, gangs and serial predators - also abusive pimps. Aunt T.T. the Boss has a watchful eye over her world, and won't be outsmarted, and no one will take what she has built, and no one, absolutely no one, destroys life in her world and gets away with it, ever!</p>

<img alt="Bio image" src="./AUNT T.T. THE BOSS_files/tt.jpg">
<h2>T.T.</h2>
<p>	T.T. was a bottom bitch for a pimp, which means she was the last prostitute in a pimp's stable of which that pimp was murdered. So, that meant T.T. was left with many kids that she felt responsible for and was left to fend for by herself and help take care of the kids that were left to streets. T.T. learned to survive on whatever Wesley and T.T. had saved. Once she found her way, she realized this world is a cruel place for poor women and women of color, and vowed to help people that she could vet, children on the streets, and abused women. For the abused women and children, she does deal out vengeance for them through her secret army... Her main enforcer and protection are the grown-up children of dead hookers whom mothers were all killed or missing by a serial type killer, the reasons these children are forced into organized crime, is so that T.T. could afford to feed and protect the unwanted children of the dead streetwalkers.</p>

<img alt="Bio image" src="./AUNT T.T. THE BOSS_files/wesley.jpg">
<img alt="Bio image" src="./AUNT T.T. THE BOSS_files/wesley_ego.jpg">
<h2>Wesley</h2>
<p>	Wesley was a young pimp who enlisted in the military as a quick escape from mob-related trouble he was trying to escape back home. As a soldier, he received a dishonorable discharge for beating up a higher ranking soldier who had beaten and murdered a woman. After he gets out of the military, he returns home and back to the game, because that's all he knew. Now, he has a new thriving pimp business and a new devilish threat taking money out of his pocket - human predators killing the streetwalkers.</p>

<img alt="Bio image" src="./AUNT T.T. THE BOSS_files/mauffie.jpg">
<h2>Mauffie</h2>
<p>	Mauffie is one of the kids T.T. saved and had taken care of after his mother came up missing. Mauffie and his mother came from England, and after T.T. located him and T-Raw as they walked the streets, T.T. thought it would be best if she sent him back to England to live with relatives. After the years past, he grew up to be quite a mobster soldier... Yet, he learned sometimes that blood is not thicker than water. Mauffie leaves in a hurry because the mob bosses wanted him dead after his uncle set him up... But, it was just in time T-Raw needed the help back in the states and this would be a timely reunion.</p>

<img alt="Bio image" src="./AUNT T.T. THE BOSS_files/t-raw.jpg">
<h2>T-Raw</h2>
<p>	T-Raw became who he is by losing his street-walking mother to the hands of a predator and was being protected by a black kid who also lost his mother at the same time (she was also a streetwalker). The black child was only 3 years older than T-Raw. They walked the streets, and had to eat - so, they became pee wee runners... T.T. knew Mauffie’s mother, as well as T-Raw's, and asked what happened to their mothers. The kids said their mothers were missing, and that's all they knew. They haven't seen them in days, and she asked if they had a place to stay. The kids did have a place to stay, but Mauffie found out the lady they were staying with was also a predator - so, they left that house and never went back. Now, they are walking the streets. They have to earn, so they became pee wee runners, which changes T-Raw’s life forever. The drug dealer they were working for accused Mauffie of stealing and starting beating him. So, T-Raw ends up committing his first murder to protect Mauffie at a very young age, of which his future can now only be in the game.</p>

Muslim-type leader for the MOB'S Gorillas.</p>

<img alt="Bio image" src="./AUNT T.T. THE BOSS_files/the_patriarch.jpg">

[Side note: The mobster did not kill Mr. Peppers; he wanted Mr. Peppers to live with the same pain the mobster had to live with as long as the mobster has to live.]<br><br>And, when that mobster is on his death bed, if Mr. Peppers is still alive, then there is an auto contract on Mr. Peppers' life.<br><br>After T.T. found Mr. Peppers, they have been chess partners, and Mr. Peppers is also Lord Mother's butler and counsel, and sometimes Lord Mother's enforcer at The Players Ball table.</p>

<h2>Silence</h2>
<p>	Silence is a young white boy whose mother was killed, and T.T. had to take and raise him from the age of 3 to 11. He was later adopted by a good family in a good hood, but couldn't adjust because he spoke with a black accent which he was made fun of and got in a lot of fights. So, he ran away from the good hood (and stop talking). He couldn't change his voice - nor who he was in his heart, and where he came from. As the years went by, he became violent. Seeing how damaged Silence was, T.T. knew he could only be an enforcer to release the caged anger from being the child of a dead hooker.</p>

	<p class="title">New Elements</p>
	<br>
	<p>
	1) YouTube Personalities Would Bring Their Followers... I Think An Extra With Followers Is Better Than An Extra With No Eyeballs Chasing Them... Views, Views, Views!!

	<br><br>
	4) The Action And Thrills And Horror And Timely Comedy Are Elements You Cannot Lose With If It Is Done With A Sense Of Belief... I Believe The Players Ball And The I-3G ( The Ill-Gotten Gaines Gathering) Is The Red Carpet Event Of The Underworld This Is Where You Would Get A Lot Of Cameos Red Carpet Strutting
	<br><br>
	5) Cars Everybody Loves Cars Mostly Street Cars,There Would Have To Be High Dollar Cars Also.. Guns, Women. Martial Arts Choreographed Correctly Catches Eyeballs. If The Fight Scenes Are Not Top Notch, You Lose Credibility With The Audience.
	<br><br>
	6) All Serial Killers Are Not Diabolical Geniuses Most Are People Who Think They Are Smarter Than The Rest Of Us In There Mind ... That Is Why In This Story A Pimp Is Delivering Street Justice To Predators Who Believe They Are Are Getting Away With It. To Also Stop The Substantial Amount Of Children Of Dead Hookers

<!-- STORYLINE-->
<div class="box">
	<p class="title">Storyline</p>
	
	<p>T.T., a woman with a lovely life, found a husband who loved her daughter as much as he loved her. But in life, things are not always what they seem. She discovered the world is a cruel place, and that the devil is on Earth. Her world becomes shattered when she finds out her new husband and soulmate is a predator and had abused and murdered her daughter. T.T. ends up killing him and had to cover up the murder and move away.
	
		She was in such pain, as T.T. is on the run, she self-medicates and spirals out of control. She doesn't care about herself anymore and turns to the life of a streetwalker. As she walks the street, a pimp comes up and tries to recruit her. T.T. turns him down cold and he is now desperate because his streetwalkers are coming up missing. A couple of weeks go by, and he sees T.T. get into a car that homeless vets told Wesley about. So, Wesley followed.
	
		As T.T. and the john go to the spot, Wesley observes and doesn't see anything out of the ordinary - so, as he is about to leave, a car drives by and the reflection reveals a shocking truth. T.T. is being beaten and strangled by the john, and Wesley knows this is the killer who's taking money out his pocket, killing his girls. This must be handled.
	
		As T.T. feels her last breath, there is a crash through the window and a vicious attack on the john that was attempting to kill her. T.T. sees Wesley beat this predator to death.
	
		After the deed is done, Wesley takes T.T. back to her hotel and doesn't say a word... T.T. gets out of the car, goes back to her hotel and rethinks her life, and decides if she's going to work for a pimp, it might as well be Wesley - the rest is history. She ends up working for Wesley till he gets out of the game and becomes his bottom bitch.
	
		As time goes on, they even get married. Now, they’re just a couple watching the children of streetwalkers. When the eyes on the streets (the homeless vets) hear or see something, they inform Wesley, and he removes the threat to the hookers like a ghost in the night, and the predator becomes the prey. T.T. and Wesley know that no one else cares that the women are being killed and that the children are being orphaned.
	
		This goes on for a while until Wesley comes across a predator who happens to be a cop. As Wesley is killing this serial killer cop, he gets killed by another cop. Wesley is now known as a cop killer. However, as time passes, T.T. gets her chance to clear Wesley's name... Years later, the cop that killed Wesley becomes a detective and is chasing his own monster.
	
		Now that T.T. is on her own again, she has to handle this differently than the last time. She now has to be responsible, ruthless, and cunning as a boss.
